# hello-world

Hi goofballs!

I'm Omeed. I love to write about myself and tell you all about my interests and what not. I like to learn about coding, Ok? That's all you really need to know about me. I don't want you to get into my business or personal life. That's not ok. Not at all.

I'm kidding! I love to write and produce music. I thought I'd learn to web design because I'm tired of working at pizza shops delivering pizza all the time. It doesn't satisfy me because it doesn't expand my mind much. I like tacos! The kind that comes from moon cheese freshly made inside a crater on the moon. Thanks everyone! Love you!
